**What is AD?**
- Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft that provides a centralized and standardized system.
- Manages and organizes information about networked resources, such as computers, users, groups, and other devices within a network. 
- It plays a crucial role in Windows-based environments.  

**Domain:**
   - A domain is a logical grouping of networked computers that share a common security and authentication database. Active Directory domains are identified by DNS names.

**Forest:**
- A forest is a collection of one or more domains that share a common schema, configuration, and global catalog. It establishes a trust relationship between domains.

**Domain Controller (DC):**
- A domain controller is a server that manages security authentication requests within a domain. It stores a writable copy of the Active Directory database and authenticates users and computers.

**Organizational Unit (OU):**
- An organizational unit is a container within a domain that can be used to organize and manage objects like users, groups, and computers. It allows administrators to apply Group Policy settings and delegate administrative authority.

**Group Policy:**
- Group Policy is a feature that allows administrators to implement and enforce specific configurations for users and computers within an Active Directory environment. It helps in managing security settings, software installation, and other configurations.

**Security Identifier (SID):**
- A unique alphanumeric identifier assigned to each security principal (user, group, or computer) in Active Directory. SIDs are used for authentication and access control.

**Global Catalog (GC):**
- The global catalog is a specialized domain controller that contains a partial replica of the Active Directory database, including a subset of all objects in the forest. It facilitates searching for objects across the entire forest.

**Trust Relationship:**
- Trust relationships define how domains within a forest trust each other for authentication purposes. They allow users in one domain to access resources in another domain.

**Active Directory Database:**
- The Active Directory database stores information about objects such as users, groups, and computers. It is replicated among domain controllers within a domain and across domains in a forest.

**LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol):**
- LDAP is the protocol used to communicate with Active Directory for querying and modifying directory information. It operates on TCP/IP and provides a standard way to access directory services.

**Kerberos Authentication:**
- Active Directory uses the Kerberos protocol for secure authentication between clients and servers. It provides strong authentication and supports single sign-on.

**DNS (Domain Name System):**
- DNS is crucial for Active Directory, as it is used for domain naming and locating domain controllers. Proper DNS configuration is essential for the functioning of Active Directory.

**Schema:**
- The schema defines the structure and properties of objects in the directory. It is common across all domains in a forest and is modified to extend or customize the types of objects that can be stored.

**Replication:**
- Active Directory replication ensures that changes made to the directory database on one domain controller are synchronized to all other domain controllers within the domain and across domains in the forest.
