---

### Physical AD Components:

**Domain Controllers (DCs):**
- **Physical:** Tangible servers hosting AD services.
- **Role:** Execute authentication requests, store AD database.

**Sites:**
- **Physical:** Represents actual locations connected by high-speed links.
- **Role:** Optimizes replication and authentication based on physical proximity.

**Subnets:**
- **Physical:** Network segments with specific IP address ranges.
- **Role:** Linked to sites, aids in efficient replication and communication.

**Network Infrastructure:**
- **Physical:** Hardware devices facilitating network communication.
- **Role:** Enables the flow of AD-related traffic between resources.

### Logical AD Components:

**Active Directory Database:**
- **Logical:** Repository storing data about network resources.
- **Role:** Logical data store accessible by DCs.

**Organizational Units (OUs):**
- **Logical:** Containers for logical organization and management.
- **Role:** Hierarchical structure for delegation and Group Policy.

**Domains:**
- **Logical:** Logical groupings of networked resources.
- **Role:** Forms security and administrative boundaries.

**Forest:**
- **Logical:** Collection of domains with shared schema and configuration.
- **Role:** Defines top-level structure, establishes trust.

**Global Catalog (GC):**
- **Logical:** Partial replica of objects across the entire forest.
- **Role:** Facilitates cross-domain object searches.

**Schema:**
- **Logical:** Defines structure and attributes of stored objects.
- **Role:** Determines object types and properties.

**Trust Relationships:**
- **Logical:** Logical links enabling secure authentication across domains.
- **Role:** Establishes trust, allows access to resources.

**Group Policy:**
- **Logical:** Set of rules applied to users and computers.
- **Role:** Centrally manages security and configuration settings.

**Logical Structure:**
- **Logical:** Arrangement of domains, OUs, and objects.
- **Role:** Defines the logical organization of resources.

### Comparison:

1. **Visibility:**
- **Physical:** Observable and measurable components.
- **Logical:** Abstract, representing the structure and organization.

2. **Management:**
- **Physical:** Involves hardware maintenance and network upkeep.
- **Logical:** Involves organizational design, policy management, and security configuration.

3. **Flexibility:**
- **Physical:** Requires physical changes for expansion or relocation.
- **Logical:** Flexible and adaptable through logical configurations.

4. **Scaling:**
  - **Physical:** Scaling may involve adding new hardware.
  - **Logical:** Scaling involves organizational and policy adjustments.
