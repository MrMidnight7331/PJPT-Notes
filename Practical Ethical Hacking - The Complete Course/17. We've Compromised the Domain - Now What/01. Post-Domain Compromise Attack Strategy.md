### Provide as much value to the client as possible
- **Try to compromise the domain again with a different strategy**
- **Dump the NTDS.dit and crack passwords**
- **Enumerate shares for more sensitive information**

### Persistence can be important
- **What to do if DA access is lost?**
- **Create a DA account (DELETE AFTER USE)**
- **Create a Golden Ticket**
