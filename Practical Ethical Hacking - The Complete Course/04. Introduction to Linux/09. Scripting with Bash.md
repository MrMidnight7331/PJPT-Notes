**IP Sweeper**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ "$1" == "" ] then echo "You forgot an IP address!" echo "Syntax: ./ipsweep.sh 192.168.1" else for ip in `seq 1 254`; do ping -c 1 $1.$ip | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d " " -f 4 | tr -d ":" & done fi
```

**Code Analysis:**
```bash
if [ "$1" == "" ]; then
  echo "You forgot an IP address!"
  echo "Syntax: ./ipsweep.sh 192.168.1"
else
```

Checks if the script is called without providing an IP address as an argument. If no argument is provided, it prints a usage message and exits.

```bash
for ip in `seq 1 254`; do
  ping -c 1 $1.$ip | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d " " -f 4 | tr -d ":" &
done
```

- It iterates over a range of IP addresses from 1 to 254.
- For each IP, it uses the `ping` command to send a single ICMP echo request (`-c 1`).
- The output is then filtered using `grep` to extract lines containing "64 bytes."
- `cut` is used to extract the fourth field (the IP address) from the output.
- `tr` is used to delete the trailing colon from the IP address.
- The `&` at the end of the line runs each iteration in the background, allowing for parallel execution.
