1. **Reconnaissance:**
- *What?* Gathering info about the target system or network.
- *How?* Passive techniques like checking public info, browsing websites, and looking at DNS records.
- *Why?* To understand the target and spot potential entry points.

2. **Scanning:**
- *What?* Actively probing the target to find open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.
- *How?* Using tools for port scanning, network mapping, and vulnerability scanning.
- *Why?* Identifying weaknesses that could be exploited.

3. **Gaining Access:**
- *What?* Trying to get unauthorized access to the target.
- *How?* Exploiting vulnerabilities found earlier, using techniques like password cracking or social engineering.
- *Why?* To simulate a real attack and assess potential risks.

4. **Maintaining Access:**
- *What?* After gaining access, the focus is on keeping it.
- *How?* Bypassing security, setting up backdoors, and maintaining persistent access.
- *Why?* Mimicking a real attacker's actions to understand the impact.

5. **Covering Tracks:**
 - *What?* Removing any signs of the ethical hacking activity.
 - *How?* Deleting logs, modifying or removing files, and restoring the system to its original state.
 - *Why?* Ensuring the ethical hacking goes undetected, leaving no evidence.
