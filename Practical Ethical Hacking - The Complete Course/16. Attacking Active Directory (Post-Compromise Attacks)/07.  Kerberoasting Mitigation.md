## 1. Service Account Management:
- Use strong, complex passwords for service accounts.
- Regularly rotate passwords to reduce the window of opportunity for attackers.

## 2. Least Privilege Principle:
- Limit the privileges of service accounts to the minimum necessary for their operation.
- Avoid using domain administrator accounts as service accounts.

## 3. Monitor for Unusual Ticket Requests:**
- Set up monitoring for abnormal TGS requests, especially from non-privileged accounts.
- Use tools like Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA) to detect suspicious activities.

## 4. Implement Managed Service Accounts (MSAs):
- Use MSAs or Group Managed Service Accounts (gMSAs), which automatically manage account passwords.

## 5. Enable Kerberos Armoring (FAST):
- Use Kerberos armoring to encrypt the entire Kerberos communication, making it harder for attackers to capture tickets.

## 6. Audit and Log Analysis:
- Regularly audit logs for unusual access patterns.
- Use Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solutions to correlate and analyze events.
## 7. Limit SPN Exposure:
- Regularly review SPNs to ensure they are necessary and minimize exposure.
- Ensure that SPNs are not associated with high-privileged accounts unnecessarily.
