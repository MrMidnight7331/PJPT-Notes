**Reading Files:**
- Open a file in read mode with `open("example.txt", "r")`.
- Use methods like `read()`, `readline()`, or `readlines()` to get file contents.
  - `read()`: Retrieves the entire file content as a string.
  - `readline()`: Gets a single line from the file.
  - `readlines()`: Gets all lines as a list.

**Example:**
```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    line = file.readline()
    lines = file.readlines()
```

**Writing Files:**
- Open a file in write mode with `open("example.txt", "w")`.
- Use the `write()` method to add content to the file.

**Example:**
```python
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, World!\n")
    file.write("This is a new line.")
```

**Appending to Files:**
- Open a file in append mode with `open("example.txt", "a")`.
- Use `write()` to add content without overwriting existing content.

Example:
```python
with open("example.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("\nThis is appended content.")
```

Reading and writing files in Python is crucial for managing external data and storing program outputs. Always close files to prevent memory leaks and maintain data integrity.
