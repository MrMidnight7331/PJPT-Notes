# Boolean Expressions and Relational Operators

Boolean expressions are expressions that are either *True or False*. They are used in *conditional statements and logical operations* to make decisions based on the *truth or falsity* of certain conditions. Relational operators are used to *compare values and create boolean expressions*. Here's an explanation of boolean expressions and relational operators in Python:

**Relational Operators:**
Python provides relational operators to compare values:

- Equality (`==`): Checks if *two values are equal.*
- Inequality (`!=`): Checks if *two values are not equal.*
- Greater than (`>`): Checks if the *left value is greater than the right value.*
- Less than (`<`): Checks if the *left value is less than the right value.*
- Greater than or equal to (`>=`): Checks if the *left value is greater than or equal to the right value.*
- Less than or equal to (`<=`): Checks if the *left value is less than or equal to the right value.*

**Boolean Expressions:**
Boolean expressions are formed by *combining relational expressions using logical operators.* The logical operators in Python are:

- Logical *AND* (`and`): Returns True if both operands are True.
- Logical *OR* (`or`): Returns True if at least one operand is True.
- Logical *NOT* (`not`): Negates the value of the operand.

**Examples:**
```python
x = 5
y = 10

# Relational operators
print(x == y)   # Output: False
print(x < y)    # Output: True

# Boolean expressions
print(x < y and y > 0)    # Output: True
print(x < y or y < 0)     # Output: True
print(not (x == y))       # Output: True
```

```python
# Boolean expressions (True or False)
print("Boolean expressions:")

bool1 = True
bool2 = 3*3 == 9
bool3 = False
bool4 = 3*3 != 9

print(bool1, bool2, bool3, bool4)
print(type(bool1))

bool5 = "True"
print(type(bool5))

less_than_equal_to = 7 <= 7

test_and = True and True  # True

test_or = True or True  # True
test_or2 = True or False  # True

test_not = not True  # False
