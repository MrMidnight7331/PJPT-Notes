# Conditional Statements

**if Statement:**
- Executes a block of code if a condition is true.

```python
x = 5
if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
```

**if-else Statement:**
- Chooses between two code blocks based on whether a condition is true or false.

```python
x = 5
if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
else:
    print("x is not positive")
```

**if-elif-else Statement:**
- Checks multiple conditions and executes corresponding code blocks.

```python
x = 5
if x > 0:
    print("x is positive")
elif x < 0:
    print("x is negative")
else:
    print("x is zero")
```

These statements help you make decisions and control program execution based on conditions. Here's an example:

```python
#Conditional Statements
def drink(money):
    if money >= 2:
        return "You've got yourself a drink!"
    else:
        return "No drink for you!"

print(drink(3))
print(drink(1))


def alcohol(age, money):
    if(age >= 21) and (money >= 5):
        return "We're getting a drink!"
    elif (age >= 21) and (money < 5):
        return "Come back with more money."
    elif (age < 21) and (money >= 5):
        return "Nice try, kid!"
    else:
        return "You're too poor and too young!"

print(alcohol(21, 5))
print(alcohol(21, 4))
print(alcohol(20, 5))
print(alcohol(20, 4))
```
