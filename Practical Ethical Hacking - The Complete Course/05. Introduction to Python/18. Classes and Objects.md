**Classes and Objects in Python:**
In Python, classes and objects are fundamental to object-oriented programming (OOP), providing a structure for code and defining custom data types.

**Classes:**
- A *class* is a blueprint or template for creating objects, defining their properties (attributes), and behaviors (methods).
  
Example:
```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def bark(self):
        print("Woof!")

    def display_info(self):
        print("Name:", self.name)
        print("Age:", self.age)
```

**Objects:**
- An object is an instance of a class, created based on the class blueprint.
- Each object has its own set of attributes and can invoke methods defined in the class.
  
**Example:**
```python
dog1 = Dog("Buddy", 5)
dog2 = Dog("Max", 3)

dog1.bark()               # Output: "Woof!"
dog1.display_info()       # Output: "Name: Buddy", "Age: 5"

dog2.bark()               # Output: "Woof!"
dog2.display_info()       # Output: "Name: Max", "Age: 3"
```

**Employees Class Example:**
```python
class Employees:
    def __init__(self, name, department, role, salary, years_employed):
        self.name = name
        self.department = department
        self.role = role
        self.salary = salary
        self.years_employed = years_employed

    def eligible_for_retirement(self):
        return self.years_employed >= 20

# Example usage:
e1 = Employees("Bob", "Sales", "Director of Sales", 100000, 20)
e2 = Employees("Linda", "Executive", "CIO", 150000, 10)

print(e1.name)
print(e2.role)
print(e1.eligible_for_retirement())
```

These examples showcase how classes and objects are pivotal in OOP, facilitating code organization, data encapsulation, and the creation of reusable entities. They enable the modeling of real-world entities, the definition of custom data types, and the construction of complex systems using principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
