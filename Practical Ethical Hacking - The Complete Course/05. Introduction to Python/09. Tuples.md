# Tuples

In Python, a tuple is an ordered collection of elements, similar to a list. However, unlike lists, tuples are immutable, meaning their elements cannot be modified once they are created:

**Tuple Creation:**
- To make a tuple, enclose comma-separated values within parentheses ( ).

```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "orange")
```

**Tuple Access:**
- Retrieve individual elements using indexing, starting from 0.

```python
print(fruits[0])    # Output: "apple"
print(fruits[2])    # Output: "orange"
```

**Tuple Immutability:**
- Tuples are immutable; you can't change their elements after creation.

```python
fruits[1] = "grape"    # This will raise an error
```

**Tuple Operations:**
- Though immutable, you can still perform certain operations like concatenation and length retrieval.

```python
fruits = ("apple", "banana", "orange")
fruits2 = ("grape", "kiwi")

combined = fruits + fruits2
print(combined)         # Output: ("apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "kiwi")

print(len(fruits))      # Output: 3

subtuple = fruits[1:3]
print(subtuple)         # Output: ("banana", "orange")
```

```python
# Tuples - Do not change, ()
grades = ("a", "b", "c", "d", "f")

# grades.pop, grades.append won't work - not mutable

print(grades[1])
```
