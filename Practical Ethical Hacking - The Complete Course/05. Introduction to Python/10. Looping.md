# Looping

**for Loop:**
- Iterates over a sequence (list, tuple, string, or range).
- Executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

Output:
```
apple
banana
orange
```

**while Loop:**
- Repeatedly executes a block of code while a condition is true.
- Continues until the condition becomes false.

```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

Output:
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

**break and continue Statements:**
- `break` exits the loop prematurely.
- `continue` skips the current iteration and moves to the next.

```python
# For loops - start to finish of an iterate
vegetables = ["cucumber", "spinach", "cabbage"]
for x in vegetables:
    print(x)

# While loops - execute as long as true
i = 1
while i < 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```
