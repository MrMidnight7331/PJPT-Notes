```python
# USER INPUT

# Example 1: Greeting the user by taking their name as input
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")

# Example 2: Getting and manipulating the user's age
age = input("Enter your age: ")
age = int(age)  # Convert input to an integer
print("You will be " + str(age + 1) + " next year.")

# Example 3: Performing a calculation based on user input for numbers and an operator
x = float(input("Give me a number: "))
o = input("Give me an operator: ")
y = float(input("Give me yet another number: "))

# Handling different operators and printing the result
if o == "+":
    print(x + y)
elif o == "-":
    print(x - y)
elif o == "/":
    print(x / y)
elif o == "*":
    print(x * y)
elif o == "**":
    print(x ** y)
else:
    print("Unknown operator.")
```

This Python code showcases user input examples, including taking the user's name, age, and performing calculations based on numeric input and operators.
