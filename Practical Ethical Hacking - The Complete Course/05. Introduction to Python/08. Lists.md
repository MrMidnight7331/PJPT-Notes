**List Creation:**
- To make a list, put comma-separated values inside square brackets.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
```

**List Access:**
- Retrieve individual elements using indexing (starts from 0).

```python
print(fruits[0])    # Output: "apple"
print(fruits[2])    # Output: "orange"
```

**List Modification:**
- Lists are mutable; you can change elements by assigning new values or using methods.

```python
fruits[1] = "grape"     # Modify an element
fruits.append("kiwi")   # Add an element to the end
fruits.remove("apple")  # Remove an element
```

**List Operations:**
- Perform various operations like concatenation, length retrieval, slicing, and iteration.

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
fruits2 = ["grape", "kiwi"]

combined = fruits + fruits2
print(combined)         # Output: ["apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "kiwi"]

print(len(fruits))      # Output: 3

sublist = fruits[1:3]
print(sublist)          # Output: ["banana", "orange"]

for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)        # Output: "apple", "banana", "orange"
```

Lists are powerful tools for managing and processing collections of items in Python. Here's an example using movies:

```python
#Lists - Have brackets []
movies = ["When Harry Met Sally", "The Hangover", "The Perks of Being a Wallflower", "The Exorcist"]

print(movies[1]) # Returns the second item in the list - index / indices
print(movies[0]) # Returns the first item in the list
print(movies[1:3]) # Returns the first number given until right before the last number given
print(movies[1:4]) # Returns all 
print(movies[1:]) # Returns everything from the number to the end of the list
print(movies[:1]) # Everything before 1
print(movies[:2])
print(movies[-1]) # Grabs the last item

print(len(movies)) # Counts items in the list
movies.append("JAWS")
print(movies) # Appends to the end of the list

movies.insert(2, "Hustle")
print(movies)

movies.pop() # Removes the last item
print(movies)

movies.pop(0) # Removes the first item 
print(movies)

amber_movies = ['Just Go With It', '50 First Dates']
our_favorite_movies = movies + amber_movies
print(our_favorite_movies)

grades = [["Bob", 82], ["Alice", 90], ["Jeff", 73]]
bobs_grade = grades[0][1]
print(bobs_grade)
grades[0][1] = 83
print(bobs_grade)
```
