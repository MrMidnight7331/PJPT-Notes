Sockets are essential for networking, enabling communication between computers over a network:

**Socket Creation:**
```python
import socket

# Create a TCP socket
tcp_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Create a UDP socket
udp_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
```

**Socket Communication:**
Methods for connection, data sending, and receiving:
```python
socket.connect(address)  # Establishes a connection to a remote address.
socket.bind(address)     # Binds the socket to a specific address and port.
socket.listen(backlog)   # Listens for incoming connections on a TCP socket.
socket.accept()          # Accepts an incoming connection and returns a new socket object for communication.
socket.send(data)        # Sends data over the socket.
socket.recv(buffer_size) # Receives data from the socket.
```

**TCP Server Example:**
```python
import socket

# Create a TCP socket
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

# Bind the socket to a specific address and port
server_address = ('localhost', 1234)
server_socket.bind(server_address)

# Listen for incoming connections
server_socket.listen(5)

while True:
    # Accept a client connection
    client_socket, client_address = server_socket.accept()

    # Receive and send data
    data = client_socket.recv(1024)
    client_socket.send(b"Received: " + data)

    # Close the client socket
    client_socket.close()
```

Socket programming in Python facilitates the creation of client-server and networked applications, offering flexibility in communication over networks using protocols like TCP and UDP. The socket module provides extensive functionality for efficient network communication.

```python
#SOCKETS - Sockets can be used to connect two nodes together. 

#!/bin/python3 
import socket
HOST = '127.0.0.1' 
PORT = 7777 

s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) #af_inet is ipv4, sock stream is a port s.connect((HOST,PORT))
s.connect((HOST,PORT))
```
