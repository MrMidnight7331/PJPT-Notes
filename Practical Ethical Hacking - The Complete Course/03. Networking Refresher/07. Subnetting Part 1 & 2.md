# Subnetting Part 1 & 2

*Subnetting* is the process of *breaking a network into smaller parts* called *subnets*, *enhancing IP address efficiency* and aiding network management. This technique involves *borrowing bits* from the *host section of an IP address* to create *subnet identifiers*, *dividing the network into multiple subnets*, each with its *unique IP address range*.

*CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation* simplifies representing IP addresses and their subnet masks. It *indicates the network prefix length*, *denoting the number of bits used* for the network part of the IP address. CIDR notation *appends a forward slash (/)* and the prefix length to the IP address.

**Example:**
- IP Address: 192.168.0.0/24
- *"/24"* means the first *24 bits* are for the network, and the remaining *8 bits* are for hosts.
- Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0.

To further subnet, you can *borrow additional bits*. If, for example, *2 bits* are borrowed, *4 subnets are created*, and the subnet mask becomes 255.255.255.192 (binary: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000).

**The resulting subnets**:
1. 192.168.0.0/26 (range: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.0.63)
2. 192.168.0.64/26 (range: 192.168.0.64 - 192.168.0.127)
3. 192.168.0.128/26 (range: 192.168.0.128 - 192.168.0.191)
4. 192.168.0.192/26 (range: 192.168.0.192 - 192.168.0.255)

*Each subnet can serve different purposes* within the network. *CIDR notation provides a concise way to define network boundaries*, fostering efficient address allocation in IP networking.
