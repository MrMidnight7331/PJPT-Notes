# TCP, UDP and the Three Way Handshake

**TCP and UDP Overview:**
- *TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)* and *UDP (User Datagram Protocol)* are *transport layer* protocols in computer networks.
 - TCP is *connection-oriented*, ensuring *reliable, ordered, and error-checked data delivery*.
- UDP is *connectionless, simpler, and lightweight*, suitable for *applications tolerating data loss* or delay.

**TCP Characteristics:**
- *Guarantees correct data delivery* through mechanisms like acknowledgement, retransmission, and flow control.
 - *Breaks data into packets*, assigns sequence numbers, and ensures proper reassembly.
 - *Widely used for applications* requiring guaranteed delivery, e.g., web browsing, email, file transfer.

**UDP Characteristics:**
- *Does not establish connections or guarantee packet delivery*, making it suitable for real-time applications.
 - *Commonly used for streaming media*, online gaming, DNS, and VoIP.

**Three-Way Handshake (TCP):**
- Process to *establish a connection before data transmission*.
- *SYN (Synchronize)*: Client sends SYN packet to the server.
- *SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge)*: Server responds with SYN and ACK flags set.
- *ACK (Acknowledge)*: Client acknowledges SYN-ACK, confirming connection establishment.

**Post-Handshake Connection:**
- After the three-way handshake, devices are ready to exchange data.
- Sequence numbers ensure correct order of data transmission and reception.

**Summary:**
- *TCP is reliable* and connection-oriented, ensuring data delivery.
- *UDP is simpler* and connectionless, suitable for applications tolerating some data loss.
- T*he three-way handshake* involves SYN, SYN-ACK, and ACK packets for TCP connection establishment.
