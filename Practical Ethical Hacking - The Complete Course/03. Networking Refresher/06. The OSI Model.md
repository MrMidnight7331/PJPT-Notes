# The OSI Model

The *OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model* is a *framework organizing communication systems into seven layers*, each with specific functions. This structured approach aids in *understanding and designing network protocols*.

**Physical Layer:**
- Handles *raw data transmission* over a physical medium.
- *Defines electrical, mechanical, and functional* characteristics.
 
**Data Link Layer:**
- Ensures *reliable data frame transmission* between connected nodes.
- *Manages error detection*, correction, flow control, and medium access.

**Network Layer:**
- *Routes data packets* across networks.
 - *Deals with logical addressing* and determines the best path using protocols like IP.

**Transport Layer:**
- *Ensures reliable data delivery* between end systems.
- *Manages segmentation*, end-to-end communication, error recovery, and flow control with protocols like TCP and UDP.

**Session Layer:**
- *Establishes*, manages, and terminates *communication sessions*.
- *Provides synchronization*, dialog control, checkpointing, and recovery.

 **Presentation Layer:**
- *Handles data representation*, encryption, compression, and formatting.
 - *Ensures* data sent by one system is understandable by another.
 
**Application Layer:**
- *Closest to the end-user*, providing services like file transfer, email, and web browsing.
 - Includes protocols such as *HTTP*, *SMTP*, *FTP*, and *DNS*.

**Key Idea:**
- OSI model *divides network communication into manageable layers*, promoting interoperability, ease of implementation, and troubleshooting.
- It's a *conceptual model*, *not always reflecting exact system implementations*, but remains a valuable reference for understanding network communication and protocols.
