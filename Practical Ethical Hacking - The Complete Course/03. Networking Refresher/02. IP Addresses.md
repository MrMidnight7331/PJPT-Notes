**IPv4**
IPv4 addresses are *32-bit numerical addresses* represented in a dotted-decimal format, such as "192.168.0.1". Each section, or *octet*, of the address consists of *8 bits* and can range *from 0 to 255*. This allows for a total of approximately *4.3 billion unique addresses*.

**IPv6**
IPv6 addresses are *128-bit addresses* represented in a hexadecimal format, such as "2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334". The longer address length of IPv6 allows for a significantly larger number of unique addresses, approximately *3.4Ã—10^38. IPv6 addresses* are *divided into eight groups* of *four hexadecimal digits*, separated by colons. *Leading zeros within a group can be omitted, and consecutive groups of zeros can be represented by a double colon (::)* to simplify the address.

**Summary**
In summary, IPv4 and IPv6 are versions of the Internet Protocol that provide an unique addresses to devices on a network. IPv4 are addresses with 32 bit, and IPv6 addresses with 128 bit. IPv6 offers a larger address space and additional features compared to IPv4.
