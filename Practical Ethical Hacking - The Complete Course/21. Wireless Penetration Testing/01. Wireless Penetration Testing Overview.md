**Assessment of wireless network:**
- WPA2 PSK
	- Everyone uses WPA2 pre-shared key
	- Small - mid sized company uses it
	- Home use
- WPA2 Enterprise
	- Uses radius / credentials to login
	- More advanced

**Activities performed:**
- Strength testing of PSK (pre-shared key)
	- Capture handshake / Crack it
- Reviewing nearby networks
	- Walkaround / Wardriving
	- Scanning networks around one
	- Why are networks on a network
	- Check for rogue devices
- Assessing guest networks
	- Attacking guest networks
- Checking network access
	- Access other APS with the guest network / other functionalities

**Hacking Process**
1. *Place*
	-  Place wireless card into monitor mode
2. *Discover*
	- Discover information about:
		- Channel
		- BSSID
		- ESSID
3. *Select*
	- Select network and capture data
4. *Perform*
	- Perform deauth attack
5. *Capture*
	- Capture WPA handshake
6. *Attempt*
	- Attempt to crack the handshake for password

### Tools needed:
- Wireless Card / *compatible with monitor mode!*
- Router
- Laptop
