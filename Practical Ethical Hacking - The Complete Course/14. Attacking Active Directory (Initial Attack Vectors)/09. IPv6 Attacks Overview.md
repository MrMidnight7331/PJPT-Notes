##  IPv6 Scanning and Reconnaissance

IPv6's large address space makes it difficult to scan for active hosts. However, attackers can use techniques like:

- **Multicast scanning**: Sending multicast packets to discover active hosts.
- **IPv6 neighbor discovery**: Using the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) to discover hosts on the same network.

##  IPv6 Spoofing

Spoofing involves sending packets with a forged source IP address. In IPv6, this can be done using:

- **IPv6 extension headers**: Maliciously crafting extension headers to disguise the source IP address.
- **IPv6 fragmentation**: Fragmenting packets to evade security controls.

## IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) Attacks

NDP is used for address resolution and router discovery. Attacks include:

- **NDP spoofing**: Spoofing NDP messages to hijack traffic or disrupt connectivity.
- **Router advertisement spoofing**: Spoofing router advertisements to redirect traffic.

## IPv6 Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) Attacks

DAD is used to detect duplicate IP addresses on a network. Attacks include:

- **DAD spoofing**: Spoofing DAD messages to disrupt connectivity or hijack traffic.

##  IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) Guard Evasion

RA Guard is a security feature that filters out malicious router advertisements. Attacks involve:

- **RA Guard evasion**: Using techniques like fragmentation or extension headers to evade RA Guard.

## IPv6 Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks

MitM attacks involve intercepting and modifying traffic. In IPv6, this can be done using:

- **IPv6 spoofing**: Spoofing IP addresses to intercept traffic.
- **NDP spoofing**: Spoofing NDP messages to hijack traffic.

## IPv6 Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks

DoS attacks involve overwhelming a network or host with traffic. In IPv6, this can be done using:

- **IPv6 flooding**: Sending large amounts of traffic to overwhelm a network or host.
- **IPv6 fragmentation**: Fragmenting packets to evade security controls and overwhelm a network or host.

To mitigate these attacks, it's essential to implement IPv6 security measures, such as:

- **IPv6 firewalls**: Configuring firewalls to filter out malicious IPv6 traffic.
- **IPv6 intrusion detection and prevention systems**: Monitoring and blocking suspicious IPv6 traffic.
- **Secure neighbor discovery**: Implementing Secure Neighbor Discovery (SEND) to authenticate NDP messages.
- **RA Guard**: Configuring RA Guard to filter out malicious router advertisements.
