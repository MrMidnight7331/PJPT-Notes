# LLMNR Poisoning Overview
> 05.05.2024

**What is Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMR):**
- Its used to identify hosts when DNS fails
- Key flaw is that the service uses a users username and NTLMv2 hash when responding.
- Used to be NBT-NS (*Netbios Name Service*)

**Example:**
![[LLMNR Poisoning Overview 01.png]]

1. Victim calls for `\\hackm` instead of `\\hackme`
2. Server knows about `\\hackme` but not `\\hackm` 
3. Victim broadcasts in the network asking if anyone knows about `\\hackme`
4. Intercept this request and respond to that, asks for the hash from the victim.
5. Crack the hash

## Practical Example

**Step1: Run Responder**

- Responds to the traffic broadcasted by victims
- Grab the hash if one is received.

```bash
sudo responder -I tun0 -dwP
```

**Step2 An Event Occurs**

- A victim broadcasts the message

**Step3: Get Dem Hashes**

- Get the hash from responder offline to further evaluate it

**Step4: Crack them Hashes**

- Use tools like Hashcat to crack the offline hash:
```bash
hashcat -m 5600 hash.txt rockyou.txt
```
