	- Con: Can cause performance issues with file copies
- **Disable NTLM authentication on network
	- Pro: Completely stops the attack
	- Con: If Kerberos stops working, Windows defaults back to NTLM
- **Account tiering**
	- Pro: Limits domain admins to specific tasks (e.g. only log onto server with need for DA)
	- Con: Enforcing the policy may be difficult
- **Local admin restrictions**
	- Pro: Can prevent a lot of lateral movement
