**What is an MFP and MFP Hacking anyway?**

Multi-Function Peripherals (MFPs) are often overlooked in penetration testing, but they can provide a wealth of information and access to a network.

- Credential Disclosure
- File System Access
- Memory Access

MFPs (Multi-Function Peripherals) are devices typically found in corporate closets, equipped with:

- Network ports
- USB drives
- Control panels with specialized applications

They offer more than just basic copy, print, and fax functions, including:

- Integration with corporate networks for scan/email capabilities
- Functionality that requires:
    - LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocols) integration
    - SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) integration
    - Network Shares

**Did You Say LDAP?**

MFPs use Lightweight Directory Access Protocols (LDAP) integration, which can be used to control access to printing, copying, and scanning. By modifying the LDAP server field in the Embedded Web Service (EWS), an attacker can capture credentials and gain access to the network.

**Why MFP Hacking Matters**

A successful MFP breach can result in credential disclosure, file system access, and memory access. MFPs are a prime target for penetration testing due to their physical accessibility, poor management, and default credentials.

**Introducing the Pass-Back Attack**

The Pass-Back Attack involves replacing the legitimate LDAP server with a malicious one, allowing the attacker to capture credentials and gain access to the network.

**Accessing the EWS**

Most MFPs ship with default administrative credentials to access the EWS. These credentials can be used to gain initial access to the MFP.

**Replace LDAP Attributes**

Once authenticated to the EWS, an attacker can modify the LDAP settings to point to a malicious LDAP server.

**Capture Credentials**
Set up a listener with netcat or responder. The next time a user inputs their credentials at the control panel, the MFP will send their information to the LDAP server under the attacker's control.

**Attacking SMTP and Windows Sign-in**

This attack can also be conducted against other settings on the MFP that support authentication, such as SMTP and Windows sign-in.

Conducting attacks on the SMTP configuration can also produce fruitful results. The existing SMTP configuration for this MFP has stored credentials for SMTP authentication that can be passed back to us, after replacing the existing SMTP server with our own SMTP server.

**Big Payout with Low Risk**

MFPs are a prime target for penetration testing due to their high payout potential and low risk.

**Get Started with MFP Hacking and Pen Testing**

To get started with MFP hacking and pen testing, you can use tools like the Printer Exploitation Toolkit (PRET) and Praeda, and learn more about pen testing services and cybersecurity consulting.
