### Brute Force Attacks:

- **Method:** In a brute force attack, an attacker systematically tries all possible combinations of passwords until the correct one is found.
- **Targets:** It can target login credentials, encryption keys, or any system protected by passwords.
- **Tools:** Automated scripts or tools are often used to speed up the process.
- **Time-Consuming:** The success of a brute force attack depends on the complexity of the password and the available computational power.

### Credential Stuffing:

- **Method:** In credential stuffing, attackers use username and password combinations obtained from previous data breaches to gain access to other accounts where users have reused passwords.
- **Targets:** It exploits the common practice of users reusing passwords across multiple online services.
- **Automation:** Automated tools are used to test large numbers of username-password pairs across various websites.

### 3. Password Spraying:

- **Method:** Password spraying is an attack where the attacker systematically tries a small number of commonly used passwords against many accounts before moving on to the next set of passwords.
- **Targets:** It targets a large number of accounts with a few, commonly used passwords to avoid triggering account lockouts.
- **Detection Avoidance:** Password spraying is designed to avoid detection mechanisms that lock accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.
